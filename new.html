			<h3>The Importance Of A Precise Definition</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p class="content">Understanding that self-esteem has an exact meaning is important. It would be unwise to dismiss definitions as mere semantics or a concern with exactitude as pedantry.The value of a precise definition is that it allows us todistinguish a particular aspect of reality from all others,so that we can think about it and work with it with clarity and focus.</p>

			<h3>Earliest Attempt To Define Self-Esteem</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p class="content">The "father" of American psychology is William James, and in his Principles of Psychology, originally published in1890, we find the earliest attempt I know of to define self-esteem:The Power Of Self-Esteem I, who for the time have staked my all on being a psychologist, am mortified if others know much more psychology than I. But I am contented to wallow in the grossest ignorance of Greek. My deficiencies there give me no sense of personal humiliation at all. Had I 'pretensions' to be alinguist, it would have been just the reverse ... . With no attempt there can be no failure; with no failure no humiliation. So our self-feeling in this world depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do. It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed potentialities; a fraction of which our pretensions are the denominator and the numerator our success:Such a fraction may be increased as well by diminishing the denominator as by increasing the numerator.</p>

			<h3>What is Self Esteem ?</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<p class="content">Most of us are children of dysfunctional families.I do not mean that most of us had alcoholic parents or were sexually or otherwise abused or that we grew up in an atmosphere of physical violence. I mean that most of us grew up in homes characterized by conflicting signals, denials of reality, parental lying, and lack of adequate respect for our mind and person. I am speaking of the average home. I recall discussing this issue one day with the distinguished family therapist Virginia Satir, who offered an exquisite and appalling example of the kind of craziness with which so many of us grew up.Imagine, she said, a scene among a child, a mother, and a father.<br>
				Seeing a look of unhappiness on the mother's face, the child asks, "What's the matter, Mommy? You look sad." Mother answers, her voice tight and constricted, "Nothing's the matter. I am fine."Then Father says angrily, "Don't upset your mother!" The child looks back and forth between mother and father, utterly bewildered, unable to understand the rebuke. She begins to weep. The mother cries to Father,"Now look what you've done!" I like this story because of its ordinariness. Let us consider it more closely.The child correctly perceives that something is troubling Mother and responds appropriately. Mother acts by invalidating the child's (correct) perception of reality; she lies. Perhaps Mother does so out of the misguided desire to "protect" her child or perhaps because she herself does not know how to handle her unhappiness. If she had said, "Yes, Mommy is feeling a little sad right now;thank you for noticing," she would have validated the child's perception. By acknowledging her own unhappiness simply and openly, she would have reinforced the child's compassion and taught something important concerning a healthy attitude toward pain; she would have de-catastrophized the pain.Father, perhaps to "protect" Mother or perhaps out of guilt because Mother s sadness concerns him, rebukes the child, thus adding to the incomprehensibility of the situation. If the mother is not sad, why would a simple inquiry be upsetting? If she is sad, why is it wrong to ask about it and why is Mommy lying? Now, to confound the child still more, Mother screams at Father, rebuking him for reproaching their child. Contradictions compounded; incongruities on top of incongruities. How is the child to make sense of the situation? The child may run outside, frantically looking for something to do or someone to play with, seeking to erase all memory of the incident as quickly as possible, repressing feelings and perceptions. And if the child flees into unconsciousness to escape the terrifying sense of being trapped in a nightmare, do we blame her well-meaning parents for behaving in ways that encourage her to feel that sight is dangerous and that there is safety in blindness?</p>
